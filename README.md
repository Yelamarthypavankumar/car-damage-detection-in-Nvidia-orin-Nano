# car-damage-detection-in-Nvidia-orin-Nano
Car damage detection using YOLOX and deployed on Nvidia Orin Nano development Kit
This project implements a real-time car damage detection system using YOLOX on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Development Kit.
YOLOX is a high-performance object detection model known for its accuracy and speed.
The Jetson Orin enables efficient edge deployment with GPU-accelerated inference.
This system detects vehicle damage from images or video streams with low latency.
It is suitable for use in automated inspections, insurance assessments, and smart garages.
## ðŸ§  About the Project

This project provides a lightweight, high-performance app for detecting car damages such as:

- Dent
- Scratch
- Crack
- Glass Shatter
- Lamp Broken
- Tire Flat

All processing is optimized for edge deployment using **TensorRT** on **Jetson Orin Nano**.
